   This repository has been made for the coursera Data Science course. In the last course, they ask to create and complete a project based on real world data.
# Introduction /Business problem
  My project consist on a program that will determine which neighbourhood is the best suitable for opening a new store, shop, restaurant or similar businesses in the city of Toronto. However, for this project I will search the best neighbourhood for opening an italian restaurant. The results obtained will change depending on which category of business we want to open, obviously. \
  When we are opening a business -our italian restaurant-, we do not want to do it so in a very saturated area in which the competition is very high. Nevertheless, we also do not want to open it on an area in which there are any similar businesses -meaning that such area is not appropiated. Therefore, we would want to open it in an area in which the saturation of similar businesses is near the average.\
  Following that reasoning, this project will analyse the neighbourhoods of Toronto to determine which areas does not have a lot of competition but are equally suitable to open a specific type of business.
# Data
This project wsas conceived as the continuity of the preovious module. Therefore, the sources of data I am going to use are:
  - For the neighbourhood locations, the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
  - For the venues, the Foursquare API
  - For creating maps, Folium library
  - For geospatial data, the csv file of Module 3 https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data
